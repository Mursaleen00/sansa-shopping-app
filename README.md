# Sansa - E-Commerce Website

Sansa is a fully functional e-commerce website designed as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in web development and user experience design. The platform offers a clean, modern design with a seamless user interface that makes browsing, shopping, and purchasing products effortless. Key features include easy navigation, secure payment options, responsive design for mobile and desktop users, and a streamlined checkout process. Sansa demonstrates my ability to create visually appealing, high-performance e-commerce websites that prioritize user experience and accessibility.

Each directory and file serves a specific purpose:

- **public/**: Contains static assets like icons and images used throughout the site.
- **src/constant/**: Holds data files, constants, and configurations such as page lists, product data, and URLs.
- **src/i18n/**: Manages internationalization (i18n) resources and language configurations.
- **src/types/**: TypeScript types for better type safety.
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions to enhance code reusability and maintainability.
- **tailwind.config.ts**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.

This structure ensures the project is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
